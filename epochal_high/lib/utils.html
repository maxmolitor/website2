<p>
Utility functions can be used across modules. To avoid name conflicts most
of them are defined as static class functions (i.e. the class mainly serves
as a namespace). Typically this class name is in the plural, e.g. "Points", "Dates" to ensure that
existing class names like "Point", "Date" are not in conflict with the namespace.

<h2>
    Cycle
</h2>
<p>Cycles simplify to switch between values in a cyclic way.</p>

<script class="doctest">

    let cycle = new Cycle(1, 2, 3)
    Doctest.expect(cycle.next(), 1)
    Doctest.expect(cycle.next(), 2)
    Doctest.expect(cycle.next(), 3)
    Doctest.expect(cycle.next(), 1)

</script>

<h2>
	Dates
</h2>
<script class="doctest">

    let feb1900 = new Date(1900, 1, 1)
    Doctest.expect(Dates.daysInMonth(feb1900), 28)
    // 1900 was no leap year
    let feb2000 = new Date(2000, 1, 1)
    Doctest.expect(Dates.daysInMonth(feb2000), 29)
    // 2000 was a leap year

    let mar1913 = new Date(1913, 2, 1)
    Doctest.expect(Dates.daysInMonth(mar1913), 31)
</script>

<p>
A tricky problem is to iterate over years, months, and days to label timelines
and calendars in a consistent way. This can lead to problems with standard
(CET) and summer time (CEST).

To illustrate the problem look at the following example. Although march has 31 days
the formatted UTC string shows "30.3". Also note that the standard
new Date() constructor uses a zero-based month:
</p>
<script class="doctest">
    let format = { timeZone: 'UTC'}
    let lastMar1913 = new Date(1913, 2, 31)
    Doctest.expect(lastMar1913.toLocaleDateString("de", format), "30.3.1913")

</script>
<p>
The following iterators guarantee that correct labels are generated:</p>

<script class="doctest">

    let lastDay = null
    for(let day of Dates.iterDays(mar1913)) {
        lastDay = day
    }
    Doctest.expect(lastDay.toLocaleDateString("de", format), "31.3.1913")

</script>

<h2>
	Polygon
</h2>
<p>An intersection of polygons is needed to compute the overlap of rotated rectangles.
We are using the library <a href="https://gist.github.com/cwleonard/e124d63238bda7a3cbfa">jspolygon.js</a> but provide a more convenient API that
is compatible with arrays of absolute points.
</p>
<p>To detect intersection with another Polygon object, the instance
    method uses the Separating Axis Theorem. It returns false
    if there is no intersection, or an object if there is. The object
    contains 2 fields, overlap and axis. Moving the other polygon by overlap
    on axis will get the polygons out of intersection.
</p>
<p>The following triangles show an overlap. Moving the triangle along the red line would remove the overlap.
</p>
<canvas id="canvas" class="grayBorder interactive">Canvas not supported</canvas>
<script class="doctest">
    let context = canvas.getContext("2d")
    // The jspolygon syntax
    let a = Polygon.fromPoints([{ x: 20, y: 20}, { x: 100, y: 100}, { x: 150, y: 50}])
    a.draw(context)
    let b = Polygon.fromPoints([{x: 70, y: 50}, {x: 150, y: 10}, {x: 200, y: 70}])
    b.draw(context)

    context.strokeStyle = '#ff0000'
    context.beginPath()
    let result = a.intersectsWith(b)
    if (result != false) {
        let {overlap, axis} = result
        context.moveTo(b.center.x, b.center.y)
        let target = Points.add(b.center, { x: overlap * axis.x, y: overlap * axis.y })
        context.lineTo(target.x, target.y)
    }
    context.stroke()
