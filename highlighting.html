                This is my Bachelor-Thesis, in which I conducted an experiment measuring the effect of a design manipulation, the highlighting of learning-relevant material, 
                on learning behaviour and success.

                    Abstract
                </div>
                Digital learning environments offer considerable opportunities for learning complex topics. Yet
                research has found that learners with deficits regarding individual learnersâ€™ characteristics necessary
                to engage in self-regulated learning (SRL) and visuospatial ability have difficulties learning in these
                environments. Considering this ambiguity, sixty (N = 60) participants were invited to learn
                about art-history on a tablet-based multi-perspective hypermedia learning environment (MHE) in
                an experiment, while learning gains and behavior were related to individual visuospatial ability. A
                Question-Panel (QP) provided learning guidance via questions concerning the learning material
                during learning. Further in the experimental group, relevant artworks concerning the QP-questions
                were visually highlighted across multiple perspectives, aiming to lower cognitive load. Results
                revealed highlighting to have supported low-visuospatial learners in attaining higher learning gains
                but limited high-visuospatial learners who scored lower learning gains than the control group. It is
                theorized that highlighting assisted low-visuospatial learners in information selection and
                perspective processing, by reducing visuospatial working-memory requirements but limited highvisuospatial
                learners to potentially attend to more artworks than suggested. Further, it is supposed
                that highlighting acted as an exogenous cue which guided attention and, thus, significantly
                increased click-rates of highlighted artworks. This study confirmed visuospatial ability as a
                predictor of learning gains in MHEs, instructional theories of digital learning environments and set
                forth concrete visual design implications for MHEs.
